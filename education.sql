In this course, you will learn how to use the Kotlin language to develop your Android applications.</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you are a complete beginner in programming or you are already an intermediate, this course will teach you how to make mobile applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Why make Android applications in Kotlin?</strong></p>\n<p>Google announced official support for Kotlin on Android in 2017. Java is no longer the only language on this platform, <em>you can now write your applications using Kotlin 100%</em> !</p>\n<p><strong>At the end of this course, you will be able to write complex Android applications</strong> , with phone / tablet view support, database storage of your information and HTTP requests to make your application connected.</p>\n<p>If you fancy becoming a mobile developer, <strong>Android is the most popular OS on users\' phones today. It represents 85% of the entire market. </strong><em>If you have an idea for an app in mind, there is a 9 out of 10 chance that your users are on Android</em> .</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Course structure</strong></p>\n<p>I think in order to learn and master a new skill, you have to practice it. This is why <strong>we are going to realize together 2 complete application projects (Notes and Weather)</strong> with all the theoretical explanations that go around.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, I structured the course as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Section (s) devoted to the Kotlin language;</li>\n<li>Section (s) devoted to Android;</li>\n<li>Application project which integrates all the concepts previously discussed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will repeat this scheme, gradually increasing the difficulty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Application projects</strong></p>\n<p>The 2 projects that we will carry out are of increasing difficulty, the <strong>first being the Note application</strong> which has the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Display notes in a dynamic list;</li>\n<li>Edit notes in a dedicated screen;</li>\n<li>Store the notes in file for persistence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following application, <strong>Weather, is more complex because it integrates more features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retrieve weather data from the Internet with the OpenWeatherMap service;</li>\n<li>Support display on phone and tablet;</li>\n<li>Store city information in a database.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>\n<p>To develop these projects, we must learn to program in Kotlin! Here are the main themes that we will address to discover the language:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Types of variables and declarations;</li>\n<li>Flow control: if / else, for, while;</li>\n<li>Define and call functions;</li>\n<li>Create classes with inheritance, interfaces and generics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the basics have been laid, we\'ll move on to more advanced concepts like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The late init and the lazy init;</li>\n<li>The Data Class, Sealed Class, Enum Class;</li>\n<li>High order functions and lambdas;</li>\n<li>Custom extension functions offered by Kotlin (let, apply, use, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Android</strong></p>\n<p>Once the language is mastered, we switch to Android, to fully discover this OS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Definition of a screen with an Activity and a Layout;</li>\n<li>Communication of information between screens with an Intent;</li>\n<li>Display lists of items;</li>\n<li>Display Dialogs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After that, we move up a gear with features that will be found in most of your applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support multi-device display (phone / tablet) with Fragments;</li>\n<li>Store information in SQLite database;</li>\n<li>Make network requests with the Retrofit library;</li>\n<li>Manage the permissions of the applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus</strong></p>\n<p><em>Because it\'s not just code that counts when developing an application</em> , we\'ll also be looking at topics that are around code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Installation of the development environment on Windows, macOS, Linux;</li>\n<li>Tour of the features of Android Studio to familiarize yourself with the interface;</li>\n<li>How to debug an application to detect errors;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation of the procedure to deploy your application on the Google Play Store</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>One last word</strong></p>\n<p>I created this course with the desire to share my passion for the Kotlin language and show you how well this new technology works with Android.</p>\n<p><strong>I hope to find you in this training and discuss with you in the Questions / Answers section. I am very involved in this part, which is probably my favorite: discussing techno with you!</strong></p>\n<p>See you soon !</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Who is this course for?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Anyone wanting to become an Android app developer.

I provide you with all the 3D objects for this game, to make it easier for you to learn the software.</p>\n<p>- I devoted an entire section to learning the Blueprint, each time with concrete examples for the sake of clarity.</p>\n<p>- We will then move on to importing and programming a hero for our game. We will discover the \"character movement\", useful for the movement of the character then we will learn how to set up a \"blueprint animation\" to animate our character (Idle, race, jump fight!).</p>\n<p>- Finally we will see how to optimize a game via commands, add particles, improve the image thanks to the volume post-process, arrange the lights, then we will see how to export our game for players!</p>\n<p><strong>So don\'t hesitate any longer and join us in this training now!</strong></p>\n', 2500000, 36, 4.4, 6957, 11, 220, '2021-07-26', 0, '2021-01-11', 0, 77772, 0, 'https://myedu-1612407.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/11/courses/1610568654942-banner.png', 'lap-trinh-doge-game-voi-unity3d'),
